    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is arianna,rhymes with brianna, and I'm a <strong>guitarist</strong> and <strong>like to draw</strong> intern at <a href="https://www.crazygames.com/game/rhythm-capture" target=_blank>crazy games</a> here in Madison, Wisco.
    <p/>
    
    <p>I think it's important to help make the internet a <strong>beautiful place</strong>, whether that be through words, photography, or web design, and I'm excited to have found a community at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> that shares my belief.</p>
    
    <p>I also think it's important to push yourself and <strong>learn</strong> one new thing every day, no matter what that may be. Did you know a duel between three people is called a <a href="http://www.futilitycloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/2010-12-16-truel.jpg">truel?</a></p>

    <p>I call <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/1855_Colton_Map_of_Wisconsin_-_Geographicus_-_Wisconsin-colton-1855.jpg">Madison, Wisconsin</a> my home, the land of dairy (Get outta here, California!). My favorite part about <b>Madison</b> is that we're a city built around a large <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">university</a>. There's a vibrant crowd here that keeps this city bold and <strong>progressive</strong>. 
    
    The isles of <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/50/50507a001a1b91078f63c8da7f340e9a529c7f22a65d0666ce1128bde8513d42.jpg">cheese</a> in every grocery store aren't so bad either.
      
    <p>You can find me in the city, <strong>camera</strong> in hand, documenting the stories around me, or in little cafe's writing about my daily <a href="http://www.kedarjoyner.com/blog/">adventures</a> and the people I meet.</p>

    <p> My husband and I recently roadtripped through Arizona listening to the band <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4iJLPqClelZOBCBifm8Fzv>pierce the veil</a>. I don't know what it is about them, but they make you want to keep driving and sing your heart out. Start with the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8wifV5RYr8">"pierce the veil"</a> first.</p>
